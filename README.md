## Project 1 : Wine Recommender API (https://github.com/arthurchiquet/Wine_recommender_api)

This project is a <ine recommender, based on user tast, expressed either through other wines, or through description. It is therefore an NLP based machine learning solution. Unsupervised learning was used to clusterise 120K vectorised wine reviews. Using distance computing, nearest wines are found.
solution is hosted and free to use : here (http://google-your-wine.herokuapp.com/)
