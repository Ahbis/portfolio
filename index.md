<div style="text-align: justify">This project is a wine recommender, based on user tastes, expressed either through other wines, or through description. It is therefore an NLP based machine learning solution. Unsupervised learning was used to clusterise 120K vectorised wine reviews. Using distance computing, nearest wines are found.

<img src="images/NYC.png?raw=true"/>


NYC Taxifare is a an API and web interface able to predict with very high accuracy, the price of taxi rides in New-York. the platform uses google cloud compute and MLflow for training, Docker and FastAPI. Lifecircle is automated through Prefect and interface is built on Heroku. The model is training neural networks over 500K entries. MAE is around 1$.

### Attrition and customer satisfaction for Shinkansen

Prediction / Machine Learning / Neural Networks

<div style="text-align: justify">
<img src="images/importance_features.png?raw=true"/>


This project was based on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan, and passengers experiences with that mode of travel. This machine learning problem aims to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regards to their contribution to the passengers overall travel experience. 


The goal of the project was to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train. This project was part of the 2022 Hackaton hosted by MIT IDSS. This more business oriented project is fully available on GITHUB.

### Attrition and customer satisfaction for OLIST

Data analysis / regression


<div style="text-align: justify">


Olist is a leading e-commerce service that connects merchants to main marketplaces in Brazil. They provide a wide range of offers including inventory management, dealing with reviews and customer contacts to logistic services.

The dataset consists of ~100k orders from 2016 and 2018 that were made on the Olist store, available as 9 csv files. Recommandations have been made, concerning sellers and products sold, on how to increase customer satisfaction (so as to increase profit margin) while maintaining a healthy order volume.
