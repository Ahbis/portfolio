This project is a wine recommender, based on user tastes, expressed either through other wines, or through description. It is therefore an NLP based machine learning solution. Unsupervised learning was used to clusterise 120K vectorised wine reviews. Using distance computing, nearest wines are found.


solution is hosted and free to use : [here](http://google-your-wine.herokuapp.com/)


Testing of the solution has been made throught T-SNE visualization : [here](https://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arthurchiquet/7a34ec908855cd6729d15a71ed25a812/raw/7f7468821b0a5d4e77f6fe7d29245ae159ddf388/Embeddings)

This project was based on the Shinkansen Bullet Train in Japan, and passengers experiences with that mode of travel. This machine learning problem aims to determine the relative importance of each parameter with regards to their contribution to the passengers overall travel experience. 


The goal of the project was to predict whether a passenger was satisfied or not considering his/her overall experience of traveling on the Shinkansen Bullet Train. This project was part of the 2022 Hackaton hosted by MIT IDSS. This more business oriented project is fully available on GITHUB.
