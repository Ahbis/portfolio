This project is a wine recommender, based on user tastes, expressed either through other wines, or through description. It is therefore an NLP based machine learning solution. Unsupervised learning was used to clusterise 120K vectorised wine reviews. Using distance computing, nearest wines are found.


solution is hosted and free to use : [here](http://google-your-wine.herokuapp.com/)


Testing of the solution has been made throught T-SNE visualization : [here](https://projector.tensorflow.org/?config=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/arthurchiquet/7a34ec908855cd6729d15a71ed25a812/raw/7f7468821b0a5d4e77f6fe7d29245ae159ddf388/Embeddings)
